There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nIn the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as “individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials”. The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function.\\r\\nBank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official. A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank.\\r\\nThe central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.\\r\\nLast year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities.'\n",

Sam Altman recently attended the Hope Global Forums 2023. The young CEO was a guest speaker at the event that witnessed the participation of an array of luminaries from diverse backgrounds.\\r\\nDuring the session ‘The Future of AI’, Altman was asked about what kept him up at night. The 37-year-old went on to describe the sci-fi stories that he watched or read while growing up. According to him, these were “really compelling stories” such as the mind virus that got in his brain, or AI’s going rogue. Describing these thoughts, Altman said that there was “something about them that really resonates with us.”\\r\\nThis premium article is free for now..\\r\\nRegister to continue reading.\\r\\nRegister\\r\\nAlready have an account?

            "  'Vikram Kochhar recalled how Shah Rukh Khan invited the cast of Dunki to his house and revealed there were a lot of security checks.'\n",
            "  'Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s upcoming film Dunki is just days away from its release and fans cannot keep calm. Ahead of the big release, actor Vikram Kochhar, who is a part of the film, has opened up about his experience when he visited SRK’s Mannat. Vikram revealed how there were security checks similar to those of the airport and added that everything was scanned. Vikram praised SRK for his humble nature and recalled how the superstar listened to suggestions from his co-stars during the film’s shoot. \\r\\nIn an interview with Showsha, Vikram said, “I was starstruck to see Shah Rukh Khan. He called us to his house, to Mannat, when we were going to meet him for the first time. The house is amazing and we went into the lift; there were a lot of security checks. There’s a huge hall, big entrance, lobby, then after that it was just like an airport security kind of a thing… or the one you do when you enter inside a five star hotel. Everything gets scanned.” \\r\\nThe actor continued, “You go up to his room, and he’s so humble and he’s so genuine. He was like ‘I have just woken up, I woke up slightly late so let’s do it. What do you think about the script and let’s start reading it.’  Him being friendly and equal with everyone is what is amazing. I have not seen that.”\\r\\n  View this post on Instagram\\r\\n  A post shared by Vikram Kochhar (@vikramkochhar)\\r\\nAccording to Vikram, working with SRK was easy because he creates a comfortable atmosphere. Unlike other stars, he listens to suggestions and allows for open discussions. There were instances during performances when the actors had different ideas, and the star was willing to try out alternative approaches. “You never feel that you’re working with a star, it’s just like if he has a suggestion and you also have a suggestion so he listens to your suggestion,” Vikram said.\\r\\nHelmed by Rajkumar Hirani, Dunki also stars Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal and Boman Irani among others. \\r\\nClick for more updates and latest Bollywood news along with Entertainment updates.

            "  'The Galaxy S23 Ultra, despite being almost an year old smartphone is still one of the best Android smartphones in the market.'\n",
            "  'Samsung Unpacked 2024 is just around the corner, where, the South Korean tech brand will showcase the latest smartphone innovations. At the same time, a lot of flagship Galaxy S series smartphones have gotten a lot more affordable than ever before.\\r\\nHere are some of the best Galaxy S series smartphones that are worth considering ahead of the Galaxy S24 series launch.\\r\\nSamsung Galaxy S23 FE\\r\\nSamsung’s Galaxy S23 FE was launched just a few months back, and the smartphone is already available at a discounted price of Rs 44,999 (including bank discounts). While it looks just like the Galaxy S23, the FE is powered by the in-house Exynos 2200 SoC, and it has a flagship-grade triple camera setup with a dedicated telephoto and an ultra-wide angle lens. The device has a premium metal frame with a glass back, and it is IP68-rated for water and dust resistance.\\r\\nJust like the other Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy S23 FE will also receive four major Android OS upgrades and five years of security updates. On top of that, with a 6.4-inch display, it is also one of the most compact high-performance Android smartphones.\\r\\nSamsung Galaxy S23\\r\\nFor Rs 54,999, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is practical and a compact Android flagship smartphone that’s worth considering. The device is based on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC for Galaxy, and it has everything that one expects from a flagship, which includes eSIM support, IP68 rating, and wireless/reverse wireless charging capability.\\r\\nOn top of that, the device has a great 6.1-inch screen, and if there is any phone that matches the form factor of a standard iPhone, it is the Galaxy S23. There are also some beautiful colour options available, and the Galaxy S23 with its slightly curved frame, glass back, and a 120Hz display at the front, makes it a simple yet elegant-looking Android smartphone.\\r\\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra\\r\\nThe flagship Galaxy S23 Ultra is now available for around Rs 97,000 on Amazon with over Rs 25,000 discount from its launch price. This is currently the flagship offering from Samsung, and it is also one of the few smartphones that offer an integrated stylus called S-Pen, a dual telephoto lens with support for up to 100x zoom, and the smartphone also has a large 2K resolution curved display with 120Hz refresh rate.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nDespite the Galaxy S24 Ultra launch just a few days away, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is still a compelling smartphone, especially for those, who want a really balanced smartphone that offers everything and a bit more that a power user expects from an Android smartphone.'\n",

            "  'Apple scored a victory on Wednesday as a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission’s import ban on some of its popular Apple smartwatches following a patent dispute with medical-technology firm Masimo.\\r\\nThe tech giant had filed an emergency request for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo’s patents.\\r\\nRepresentatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nU.S. President Joe Biden’s administration declined to veto the ban on Dec. 26, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.\\r\\nMasimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.\\r\\nThe ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels.

            "  'When Kashyap Reddy was just 10 years old, he used to draw board games in his notebook. “I would try to get the other kids to come and play the games that I had created, and I would teach them,” Reddy recalls, reflecting on his initial draw to games. As Reddy grew older, he started playing online games such as Football Manager and competed with players globally. Years later, he went on to pursue his ambition of building his own game, the hugely popular mobile cricket game Hitwicket.\\r\\n“There was a huge opportunity to build something on similar lines as football for cricket, particularly because cricket is even more of a strategic and thinking game,” Reddy told indianexpress.com in an interview. “Cricket is inherently very sticky and engaging,” he said, adding that although the sport is hugely popular in India, no one had earlier attempted to build a game around the concept.\\r\\nThis premium article is free for now..\\r\\nRegister to continue reading.\\r\\nRegister\\r\\nAlready have an account?

He said that while people spend thousands of rupees on mainstream entertainers, they don’t watch “real cinema”. This trend, he said in a new interview, is endangering the art form itself.\\r\\nIn an interview with Jist, while discussing Joram’s box office performance, he said while gesturing at the audience, “Inmein se kisi ne nahi dekhi hogi (no one here must have watched the film). I am telling you, yeh yetharth hai (it is a possibility). We had purposely released Joram in very few theatres because we wanted to gauge if the audiences’ brains work the same way as we think, or if they only want to watch other kind of films. People who went to watch the film really liked it, they themselves are promoting it by word or mouth, telling ten other people to watch it. But the majority of the people don’t believe in such films, and even if they do, they want to watch them for free. The same people will take a loan to watch other kinds of films, they are okay doing that, it’s their taste. Our fight is about this. We want to see how interested they are in watching the kind of films we want to make.”\\r\\nYou have exhausted your monthly limit of free stories.\\r\\nRegister to read more stories\\r\\nContinue With:-\\r\\nGoogle\\r\\nFacebook\\r\\nEmail\\r\\nAlready have an account?

Another USD 1.2 billion bonds are due in March 2025 and another USD 600 million in April 2026.\\r\\n“We are looking to put in place a refinancing package that will include deleveraging (some debt), extending maturities and manageable size,” said Omar Davis, President – Strategy at Vedanta Resources.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nHe did not give details of the refinancing but expressed confidence in being able to achieve well before due maturities. “We want less big towers (size of loans) and longer maturity periods,” he said.\\r\\nOn Thursday, S&P Global Ratings revised the rating outlook on Vedanta Resources to negative from stable to “reflect the heightened refinancing risk”.\\r\\nAt the same time, it affirmed its ‘B-‘ long-term issuer credit rating on the company, anticipating it will raise more funds before end-2023.\\r\\n“Vedanta Resources’ large debt maturities that require external financing present downside rating risk,” it had said. “We estimate the company will have a funding gap of as much as USD 2 billion until August 2024.” Vedanta Resources has debt maturities of about USD 3 billion from now until August 2024, it said.\\r\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nDavis however said the amount being mentioned also includes bank loans. He said the company raised USD 500 million by selling part of its stake in 64 per cent-owned Vedanta Ltd together with dividends and brand fees.\\r\\nVedanta is sure about its deleveraging and degreasing plans and has clear sight over dividend and cash flow from operating companies, which gives it the comfort of refinancing the bonds maturing between 2024 and 2026, he added.'\n",
